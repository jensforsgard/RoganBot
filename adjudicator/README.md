# adjudicator

The adjudicator module is the game engine. It includes the fundamental classes
(Variant, Game, Map), and all functions related to entering orders and
progressing the game.

The adjudicator may be used as a stand alone module to run a single game of
diplomacy. Please see the notebook ../examples/game.ipynb for a users guide,
including instructions for how to enter orders.
