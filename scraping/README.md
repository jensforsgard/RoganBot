# RoganBot: Scraping Module

This module contains the code necessary for scraping an opening database for a variant of Diplomacy from webDiplomacy and vDiplomacy.

Please check in the 'data' folder whether the database you are looking for is already available, before scraping.

In order to keep the strain on the servers to a minimum, we ask every user that scrapes a somewhat comprehensive database to push both the database and the and the updates version of 'data/variants.csv' to the repository. We do not want multiple players scraping the same
database. Do not push the directories of html files.

Instructions for how to use the code are available in the Jupyter notebook 'scraping.ipynb'.
If you have not used Jupyter notebooks before, then we suggest that you install Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/).
